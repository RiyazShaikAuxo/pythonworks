A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long we don't exit.

This is the reason that built-in functions like id(), print() etc. are always available to us from any part of the program. Each
module creates its own global namespace.


    the innermost scope, which is searched first, contains the local names
    the scopes of any enclosing functions, which are searched starting with the nearest enclosing scope, contains non-local, but also non-global names
    the next-to-last scope contains the current moduleâ€™s global names
    the outermost scope (searched last) is the namespace containing built-in names
